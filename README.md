This is a multi-user application implemented using Unity3D (v2019.4) and Photon Unity Networking (PUN). 
Users can move in a 3D factory, lift individually light boxes into containers or collaborate to put heavy boxes in containers. 
This cross plateform application was tested in a normal desktop and in an Oculus Quest Headset.
